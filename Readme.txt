PokeList is going to be a lot more complicated than I originally thought.
Some Pokemon have dashes in their name, some have ':' in their name, and some are supposed to have
spaces. I am going to have to create some sort of function that takes those special case pokemon and fixes
their names. Learned about RegEx today :s (1/16/24)
